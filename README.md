1. <b> Approach </b>: 
    I have used the BDD approach to write the test-script. Each steps is glue to the resepctive step-defination file.
    To generate report very impressive report which give you whole understanding of each steps.

2. <b> Test Run Strategy </b>: You can run test based on platform. For that you just need to change the platform variable value from <b>"Config/Common.properties"</b> file
You can run the code using mvn verify and as well as using testNG xml too.

3. <b> Test Assertion Strategy </b>: To do assertion I used testNG assertion methods which verify each and every steps running as expected or not.
